# Proof: Hooks Are NOT Running in This Session

## Evidence

### 1. Test File Creation Succeeded
When I ran:
```bash
Write: test.block-test.txt
```
Result: File was created successfully (should have been blocked)

### 2. No Hook Output in My Actions
- Never saw "Hook stopped execution" messages
- Never got exit code 2 from my operations
- Never saw the stopReason messages

### 3. What Actually Happened
- I tested the hook mechanisms in isolation
- The code works when run manually
- But Claude Code (my instance) doesn't have hooks configured

## The Reality

1. **Hooks exist and work** ✓
2. **JSON output mechanism works** ✓  
3. **Universal-hook can block with exit 2** ✓
4. **But they're not running in this session** ✗

## Why This Matters

The hooks would need to be configured in:
- My Claude Code instance's settings
- The `.claude/settings.json` that Claude Code reads at startup
- Not just in the project we're working on

## Conclusion

I've been testing that the hook code works correctly, but I haven't actually been blocked by any hooks because they're not integrated into my Claude Code runtime.

The implementation is correct, but it's not active in this conversation.
